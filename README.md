I had lofty persuits in looking at pre and current pandemic CitiBike data. I wanted to watch trends as we entered the pandemic in March of 2020 through the end of 2020 to observe changes from a pre pandemic NYC through a post, allbeit recently, post pandemic NYC. Below are images of my three dashboards I connected with AskBCS who suggested uploading proof of my errors and my dataset size when submitting this first time. I apologize for not understanding the size of my dataset prior to coming up with these ideas I should have limited my scope significantly but got ahead of myself as I use CitiBike and am from NYC. 

This first dashboard shows the breakdown of subscribers and users. The piechart simply shows the total counts in 2020 of subscribers and users. I then was curious of the ages of those users so I broke it down by birth year. This found some rather interesting data showing a grouping of customers and a few subscribers born before 1900. This would make them well over 100 which is not only impressive but also unlikely. This shows age verification data may have users not sharing their true birthdays with CitiBike.

Looking now at our most popular stations in 2020 I looked across the full year to find the most popular stations to pick up a ride. I looked at just the top ten as there was a bit of a drop off after 70k. Mapping these we are able to see the most popular pickup locations are around central park which is not suprising especially durring 2020. In a croweded city that park is an oasis.

Looking at our ending stations where riders returned to I was facinated to see our top two starting sites continued on to be our top two ending sites in reversed order this could mean people are going for round trip rides through these sites. I was also suprised to see people ending in New Jersey but rides not beginning in New Jersey at the same rate.

This is the size error I encountered.

This is the original file I used the makecsv.ipynb file to create and split out dates and times. I initally wanted to make a file for 2020 and 2019 (covidbike.csv) but this file was too large to the point my machine froze. I apologize for getting the scope and scale wrong I would love to be able to use this data
