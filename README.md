# citibike

I had lofty persuits in looking at pre and current pandemic CitiBike data. I wanted to watch trends as we entered the pandemic in March of 2020 through the end of 2020 to observe changes from a pre pandemic NYC through a post, allbeit recently, post pandemic NYC. Below are images of my three dashboards I connected with AskBCS who suggested uploading proof of my errors and my dataset size when submitting this first time. I apologize for not understanding the size of my dataset prior to coming up with these ideas I should have limited my scope significantly but got ahead of myself as I use CitiBike and am from NYC.
